WorkoutTracker
==============

Create an Android Mobile app that tracks fitness for bicycle riders and for people who participate 

in spinning classes. It has to communicate with accessories using both BLE and ANT protocols. At a 

minimum it should work with cadences sensor and heart rate monitors. Other accessories should be 

able to be added as well.

The app needs to chart speed, distance, calories expended and heart rate at a minimum. Heart rate 

limits and warnings must be incorporated. GPS needs to be accessed for distance, speed and altitude.

Data should be recorded and stored every second and should be presented in a graphical format to the 

user on user’s device. Real time data, which is selectable, should be displayed on the device as well as 

wearable components such as the Galaxy gear. 

Historical data needs to be stored and presented to the user in graphical form upon request. Data can 

also be exported in a spreadsheet readable format. Historical data shall include GPS information that 

can be mapped.

A companion application is also required to analyze the historical data. This application should run on a 

Windows OS as a minimum.


As a team, deliver the following products by the week of finals:

1. A consolidated requirements document

2. Test Plan

a. Use case diagrams for the mobile app

b. Use case descriptions for the mobile app

c. Activity diagrams for the mobile app

d. A written list of requirements (see template)

i. Highlight requirements that will be completed

a. Create a series of test scripts that will test the application to the requirements

b. Develop a test matrix that will identify which requirements are tested by each script

3. Research paper on how the app will communicate with the accessories using the BLE and 

ANT protocols. This should provide all the information needed to program the interface to 

these devices for both Android and IOS devices. This has to be a collaborative effort with 

contributions from at least three students.

4. Development

5. Complete testing per test plan

6. Team presentation

a. Setup a code repository

b. The app will be simulated using web technology.

c. MVC architecture will be used

d. A database will be incorporated

e. Test classes will be utilized that will simulate the sensors and provide back realistic ‘real 

time’ data

a. Document the test results

b. Setup a bug tracking system

a. Present the project during finals week
